# Reusable Finite State Machine using C++
![](https://github.com/shamim-akhtar/fsm-cpp/blob/main/Featured.jpg)

There are several ways you can implement a finite state machine using C++. The easiest and fastest way probably is to use the enumerator type and the switch-case statement. However, in this tutorial, we are not going to do that. Instead, we will use a slightly sophisticated, more robust, generic class-based approach to reuse across multiple projects.

At the same time, we also want to extend the functionality by using functors in the same framework.
But first, letâ€™s recap on what is a Finite State Machine.

## Definition
Finite State Machine (or FSM in short) is a computational pattern that defines and models state behaviour.
At any given time, a Finite State Machine can exist in only one state out of a set of a possible number of states. This state can change to another in response to some inputs (sometimes called events).

The process of switching from one state to another is called a transition.
